This is a digitally mediated class project!
=====================================

For our project, we will focus on Automatic Story Generation. Our objective is to provide an inanimate object with a “voice”, that tells a story. However, while researching for methods, and different approaches to address our objective as we envision it, we will build a functional system with these capabilities. While this task may be looked upon as a simple Software Engineering problem, the literature available shows it is not. Hence, we have divided our problem statement in two parts:

1. Build a System: How do we integrate information produced by varied artificial sources to produce simple coherent text.
2. Tell a Story: Can we mediate these texts into a simple story about New York City, which involves the aggregated data. 

This idea appealed to us because of the simple fact that stories are omnipresent, they are pervasive, and they can be of immense use in extracting un-apparent but important information from literary sources, or structured data (e.g. Stock market information, weather information). A point worth noting though is that, it has been proved hard to impose structures to stories, and this makes story generation a non-trivial problem from a NLP-NLG perspective.
